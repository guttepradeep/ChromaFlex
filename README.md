Image Color Transformation Project (PIL Library, Python) I built a project using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to dynamically alter image colors by transforming them into arrays. This project allowed me to:

 ** Perform pixel-wise manipulation of image data, leveraging NumPy arrays for faster computation.
  Apply various color filters and transformations to create customized image outputs.
  Automate the color change process for multiple images, improving efficiency in tasks like photo editing or batch processing. This project deepened my understanding of image processing and reinforced my Python        programming skills, particularly in the areas of array manipulation and library integration.**
